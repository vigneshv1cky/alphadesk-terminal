"""SEC Form 4 insider trades, read straight from EDGAR.

Replaces an `openbb-sec` dependency that existed for this one feature. Two
reasons to drop it: openbb-core/openbb-sec are AGPL-3.0-only while this project
is MIT (see docs/data-sources.md), and pulling a provider framework in to parse
one well-defined XML schema was never a good trade — `ingest/edgar.py` already
talks to SEC directly and this is ~120 lines against that.

Two things about Form 4 that are easy to get wrong:

  1. `primaryDocument` in the submissions JSON points at the XSL-RENDERED view
     (`xslF345X06/form4.xml`), which is HTML, not the data. The raw XML sits in
     the same folder under the bare filename — strip the `xsl*/` prefix.
  2. A Form 4 carries BOTH non-derivative (ordinary shares) and derivative
     (options, RSUs) tables. Only the first answers "did an insider buy or sell
     stock"; derivative rows are grant and exercise bookkeeping and would swamp
     the signal.

Institutional ownership (13F) is deliberately NOT here — Form 13F is filed BY a
manager listing THEIR holdings, so it cannot answer "who holds this stock".
Ownership comes from the user's vendor that carries it (ingest/ownership.py).
