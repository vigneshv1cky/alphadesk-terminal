"""Ask a question of one SEC filing, answered ONLY from that filing's own
text, every claim backed by a verbatim quote.

Attribution here is stronger than the news screener's: the screener cites by
article INDEX and resolves that index back to a URL we already control (the
model's own idea of a URL is never trusted). A filing is one document, not a
numbered list, so there's no index to cite — instead the model is required to
quote verbatim, and every quote is checked as an actual substring of the
cached filing text before it's returned. A quote that doesn't verify is
dropped, not shown. The model can claim anything; only quotes that actually
appear in the SEC document survive.
