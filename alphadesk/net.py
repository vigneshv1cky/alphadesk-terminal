"""Socket deadlines for vendor SDKs that ship without them.

`alpaca-py`'s REST client takes no timeout argument and calls requests'
`Session.request` without one — and requests' default is to wait forever. That
is not a slow request, it is an unbounded one.

It matters because of how this app serves: FastAPI runs every endpoint here as
a sync `def`, which Starlette hands to a 40-worker threadpool. A hung upstream
therefore does not fail a request — it parks a worker until the OS gives up on
the socket. Forty of those and the API stops answering entirely, `/healthz`
included, because that is a sync endpoint too. The uptime check would fire only
once the terminal was already wedged.

Six endpoints reach an Alpaca SDK on the request path (quote, movers, chart,
tape and both filings routes), so the exposure is real rather than theoretical.

Other HTTP calls here use urllib with an explicit timeout
internally, so it is bounded even though it is slow.
