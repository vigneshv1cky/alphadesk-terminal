"""Import-and-call smoke tests.

These exist because of a real bug: a refactor deleted module-level constants
that sat BETWEEN functions, and every module still imported cleanly — the
breakage was a NameError that only fired when the function was actually
called. `import x` is not proof that `x` works.

Anything with a cheap, side-effect-free call path belongs here.
